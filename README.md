# ML-Based-OCR
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts handwritten or printed text from images into editable and searchable digital text.
OCR plays a crucial role in various applications, such as document digitization, text extraction from images, automatic data entry, and text-to-speech systems.
The goal is to showcase an ML-based OCR system that utilizes machine learning algorithms to accurately recognize characters in images.
The dataset consists of 1000 images, each containing 5 characters, all alphabets. The objective is to split these images into individual characters and develop a robust system for character recognition.
